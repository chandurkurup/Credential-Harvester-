# Deployment Steps

## Pushing to GitHub

To save your changes to your GitHub repository, run the following commands in your terminal.

1.  **Stage all new and modified files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Commit the staged files with a message:**
    (Replace "Your commit message" with a brief description of the changes.)
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

3.  **Push the commit to your main branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
